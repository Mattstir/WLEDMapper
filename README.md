# WLEDMapper

Usefull tool to create [ledmaps](https://kno.wled.ge/advanced/mapping/) for [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED)

Use: https://mattstir.github.io/WLEDMapper/

## Motivation
> I've often found myself constructing WLED projects with intricate wiring, such as text displays. While WLED's 1D effects are already impressive for these setups, I've always wanted to integrate its 2D effects. LED maps in WLED facilitate the remapping of matrices to hardwired pixels, bypassing gaps. However, aligning these maps accurately can be quite cumbersome. This tool was developed to make that process easier.

## Guide
The tool is designed to be intuitive. Additionally, you can find a [detailed guide](./guide.md) with an example.


## Development
Note: This tools is still in its early stages, so there can be bugs and unpolished.
